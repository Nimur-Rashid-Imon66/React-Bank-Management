# About It
```
I used React, Tailwind, and JavaScript as technology and local storage as a database. I think it is an amazing experience to self-test about so far I have learned React.

Through this project, I have implemented some functionality related to bank transactions, like:
    o Add User Account
    o Add User Income
    o Show User Information
    o Transfer Money Between User
    o Withdraw Money

```
